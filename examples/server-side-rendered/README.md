# Example server-side React App

Example server-side React app using the BloomReach Experience SDK for React. The app uses [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)
as framework for creating a server-side rendered app.

## Install and run

First, download and install the [BloomReach SPA demo project](https://github.com/onehippo/hippo-demo-spa-integration)
by following the instructions in the *Build Demo CMS project* section of the above link. Then run it by following the 
instructions in *Run Demo CMS project*.

Next, build and run the React app as followed:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To have the React app render the CMS site preview you will need to setup a reverse proxy. See section *3.2 Server-side 
apps* of the Hippo Lab: [Integrate a React application with BloomReach Experience](https://www.onehippo.org/labs/integrate-a-react-application-with-bloomreach-experience.html).
